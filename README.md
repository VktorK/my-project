# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation#installation)

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/VktorK/my-project.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd my-project

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install
    npm install

Update all the dependencies using composer

    composer update

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate --seed

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve
    npm run dev
    npm run build
    vite

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000


**TL;DR command list**

    git clone https://github.com/VktorK/my-project.git
    cd my-project
    composer install
    npm install
    npm run dev
    npm run build
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    vite
    
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, roles, cars, car-brands, car-models. This can help you to quickly start testing the api and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DatabaseSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php

Or run the database seeder and enjou

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh
